;; --single-update file
;;        Update tag files for single file.  It is considered that file was updated, and other files were not updated.  The file must be relative path name from  the  current  direc‚Äê
;;        tory.  This option implies the -i option.  If the file is new then --single-update is ignored, and the processing is automatically switched to normal incremental updating.
